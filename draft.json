  "script": "Hey everyone! Have you ever built a really robust custom React hook, say for data fetching or managing some complex UI state, only to find yourself struggling to make it truly flexible for different rendering scenarios? I\u2019ve been there so many times. Early in my career, I\u2019d return `data`, `isLoading`, and `error` from a hook, then have to write a bunch of conditional JSX *outside* the hook. It worked, but it always felt like the hook was doing *logic*, while the component was doing *logic and rendering decision-making*, leading to duplicated patterns.\n\nThen, I had this \"aha!\" moment when revisiting the old render props pattern, but through the lens of modern hooks. What if our custom hook didn't just return data, but also accepted a *function* that knew how to *render* that data? It's the \"Prop Render Pattern\" with hooks, and it's a game-changer. Imagine a `useDataLoader` hook that you pass a `render` function to \u2013 `useDataLoader({ renderSuccess, renderLoading, renderError })`. Suddenly, your hook handles the lifecycle and state, and *you* control the UI output directly where you consume the hook. It makes your hooks incredibly versatile and clean. Give it a try, it truly decouples concerns!",

  "blog": "# Unlocking Ultimate Flexibility: The ReactJS Hook Prop Render Pattern\n\nEver found yourself reaching for `children` props to make a component customizable, but then wished your custom *hook* could also dictate *how* certain states are rendered? Or perhaps you've created a brilliant data-fetching hook, but every time you use it, you find yourself writing repetitive `if (isLoading)` and `if (error)` JSX blocks in the consuming component. It's a common struggle, and it's precisely where the \"Prop Render Pattern\" with React Hooks shines.\n\nIn my experience building complex applications and design systems, separating concerns effectively is paramount. We strive for hooks that encapsulate logic and state, and components that handle UI. But what happens when the logic *influences* the UI in a way that\u2019s too granular for the component to decide, yet too UI-specific for the hook to directly render? That's the sweet spot for this pattern.\n\n## Why This Matters in Real Projects\n\nImagine you have a `useUserProfile` hook that fetches user data.\nA typical usage might look like this:\n\n```typescript\nfunction UserProfileCard({ userId }: { userId: string }) {\n  const { user, isLoading, error } = useUserProfile(userId);\n\n  if (isLoading) {\n    return <LoadingSpinner />;\n  }\n\n  if (error) {\n    return <ErrorMessage message={error.message} />;\n  }\n\n  if (!user) {\n    return <p>No user found.</p>;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>{user.name}</h2>\n      <p>{user.email}</p>\n      {/* ... more user details */}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis works perfectly fine for simple cases. But what if `UserProfileCard` needs to display user data differently in a dashboard versus a settings page? Or if the `LoadingSpinner` and `ErrorMessage` need to be bespoke for each context? You'd end up duplicating conditional rendering logic or passing increasingly complex `renderLoading` and `renderError` *props* to `UserProfileCard`, which then passes them to\u2026 what? This is where we elevate the \"render prop\" concept directly into the custom hook.\n\n## Deep Dive: The Prop Render Pattern with Hooks\n\nThe core idea is simple: instead of your custom hook returning raw data and status flags, it can accept *functions as props* that it invokes at specific points in its lifecycle. These functions then return the React nodes to be rendered.\n\nLet's refactor our `useUserProfile` hook to embrace this pattern.\n\nFirst, a simplified `useUserProfile` hook that supports render functions:\n\n```typescript\nimport React, { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';\n\ntype User = {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n  bio?: string;\n};\n\ntype UseUserProfileOptions<TLoading, TError, TSuccess> = {\n  userId: string;\n  renderLoading: () => TLoading;\n  renderError: (error: Error) => TError;\n  renderSuccess: (user: User) => TSuccess;\n  renderNotFound?: () => React.ReactNode;\n};\n\n// Simulate an async API call\nasync function fetchUserById(userId: string): Promise<User | null> {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      if (userId === 'user-123') {\n        resolve({ id: 'user-123', name: 'Alice Smith', email: 'alice@example.com', bio: 'Frontend Dev' });\n      } else if (userId === 'user-404') {\n        resolve(null); // Simulate not found\n      } else if (userId === 'user-500') {\n        throw new Error('Server error!'); // Simulate API error\n      }\n      resolve(null);\n    }, 1000);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction useUserProfile<TLoading, TError, TSuccess>(\n  options: UseUserProfileOptions<TLoading, TError, TSuccess>\n): TLoading | TError | TSuccess | React.ReactNode {\n  const { userId, renderLoading, renderError, renderSuccess, renderNotFound } = options;\n\n  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    let isMounted = true;\n    const loadUser = async () => {\n      setIsLoading(true);\n      setError(null);\n      setUser(null);\n      try {\n        const userData = await fetchUserById(userId);\n        if (isMounted) {\n          setUser(userData);\n        }\n      } catch (err) {\n        if (isMounted) {\n          setError(err as Error);\n        }\n      } finally {\n        if (isMounted) {\n          setIsLoading(false);\n        }\n      }\n    };\n\n    loadUser();\n\n    return () => {\n      isMounted = false;\n    };\n  }, [userId]); // Only re-run if userId changes\n\n  if (isLoading) {\n    return renderLoading();\n  }\n\n  if (error) {\n    return renderError(error);\n  }\n\n  if (!user && renderNotFound) {\n    return renderNotFound();\n  }\n  \n  if (user) {\n    return renderSuccess(user);\n  }\n\n  // Fallback for unexpected states\n  return null;\n}\n```\n\nNow, consuming this hook becomes incredibly powerful and declarative:\n\n```typescript\nimport React from 'react';\n// Assuming useUserProfile and types are in './hooks/useUserProfile'\n\nfunction DashboardUserWidget() {\n  const renderedContent = useUserProfile({\n    userId: 'user-123',\n    renderLoading: () => <p className=\"text-blue-500\">Loading user profile...</p>,\n    renderError: (error) => <p className=\"text-red-500\">Failed to load: {error.message}</p>,\n    renderSuccess: (user) => (\n      <div className=\"bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md text-white\">\n        <h3 className=\"text-lg font-bold\">{user.name}</h3>\n        <p className=\"text-sm\">{user.email}</p>\n        <p className=\"text-xs italic mt-2\">{user.bio}</p>\n      </div>\n    ),\n    renderNotFound: () => <p className=\"text-yellow-500\">User not found!</p>\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <h2 className=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4\">User Details</h2>\n      {renderedContent}\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction SettingsPageUserPreview() {\n  const renderedContent = useUserProfile({\n    userId: 'user-123', // Or some other user ID for settings\n    renderLoading: () => <div className=\"animate-pulse bg-gray-200 h-16 w-full rounded\"></div>,\n    renderError: (error) => (\n      <div className=\"bg-red-100 border border-red-400 text-red-700 px-4 py-3 rounded relative\" role=\"alert\">\n        <strong className=\"font-bold\">Error!</strong>\n        <span className=\"block sm:inline\"> {error.message}</span>\n      </div>\n    ),\n    renderSuccess: (user) => (\n      <div className=\"border border-gray-300 p-3 rounded flex items-center space-x-4\">\n        <img src={`https://i.pravatar.cc/40?u=${user.id}`} alt={user.name} className=\"w-10 h-10 rounded-full\" />\n        <div>\n          <p className=\"font-medium\">{user.name}</p>\n          <p className=\"text-sm text-gray-500\">{user.email}</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <section className=\"mt-8\">\n      <h2 className=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-4\">Your Profile Snapshot</h2>\n      {renderedContent}\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nNotice how `DashboardUserWidget` and `SettingsPageUserPreview` completely control the visual output for each state, even though they both use the *same* `useUserProfile` hook. The hook takes care of the data fetching logic, and the components provide the render functions. This is powerful!\n\n## Insights Most Tutorials Miss\n\n1.  **True Separation of Concerns:** This pattern allows your custom hook to be purely about *logic* and *state management*, completely divorced from *rendering details*. The UI logic moves from the hook's return consumer to the hook's *input* consumer.\n2.  **Enhanced Reusability:** Your `useUserProfile` hook can now be used across vastly different UIs without needing modifications or prop drilling for rendering specifics. It becomes a plug-and-play data layer with rendering control.\n3.  **Testability:** You can more easily test the hook's core logic (loading, error handling, data transformation) independently, mocking the render functions. Similarly, you can test the consuming component by passing mock render functions to the hook.\n4.  **Performance Considerations:** When passing these render functions directly into the hook's options, especially if they are defined inline, they can cause unnecessary re-renders. Always wrap your `render*` functions in `useCallback` if they depend on props or state from the consuming component, or if the hook itself doesn't memoize its options object.\n\n    ```typescript\n    // In DashboardUserWidget\n    const renderSuccessCallback = useCallback((user: User) => (\n      <div className=\"bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md text-white\">\n        {/* ... */}\n      </div>\n    ), []); // Empty dependency array if renderSuccess doesn't depend on outer scope\n\n    const renderedContent = useUserProfile({\n      userId: 'user-123',\n      renderSuccess: renderSuccessCallback,\n      // ... other render functions\n    });\n    ```\n    This is crucial for preventing the hook from re-running `useEffect` or re-evaluating its internal state due to a new function reference being passed on every parent re-render.\n\n## Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n*   **Overuse:** Not every hook needs this. If your hook always renders the same UI or the rendering logic is simple and never changes, returning `data`, `isLoading`, `error` is perfectly fine and often cleaner. This pattern introduces a bit more boilerplate. Use it when you anticipate *multiple, significantly different ways* the hook's output might need to be rendered.\n*   **Complexity Creep:** If your `render*` functions become extremely long or complex, it might be a sign that the consuming component is taking on too much responsibility. Break those render functions out into separate, smaller components.\n*   **Type Juggling:** While TypeScript provides excellent support, defining types for complex render functions can sometimes be tricky. Stick to clear `(data: Type) => React.ReactNode` signatures.\n*   **Unintended Closures:** If your render functions close over values that change frequently and you don't use `useCallback`, you might run into stale closures or unnecessary re-renders. Be mindful of your `useCallback` dependencies.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\nThe Prop Render Pattern, when integrated with custom React Hooks, is a potent tool for achieving maximum flexibility and clean separation of concerns. It transforms your hooks from mere data providers into intelligent orchestrators that delegate rendering decisions to the consuming component. By embracing this pattern thoughtfully and minding the performance implications of `useCallback`, you can build truly reusable, testable, and adaptable React applications. Add it to your mental toolkit for those moments when `children` just isn't quite enough, and you need that ultimate control over rendering logic at the hook's consumption point.\n\n---\n*(End of Blog Post)*",
